# 📻 Wi-Fi Walkie-Talkie

A friendly, retro-styled local network messaging app for Windows, Linux, and Mac. Chat with anyone on the same Wi-Fi network without needing internet or a server!

## ✨ Features

- 🌍 **Public Mode**: Open chat visible to everyone on the network.
- 🔒 **Secret Mode**: End-to-end encrypted chats (share a password to join).
- 🎨 **Retro UI**: Friendly, colorful terminal interface with cute ASCII art.
- ⚡ **Zero Config**: No IP addresses to type. Just run and chat.
- 👋 **Peer Discovery**: Automatically see who else is online.

## 🚀 One-Line Install & Launch

This single command installs dependencies, downloads the app, and launches it immediately!

### For Windows PowerShell (Recommended)
Copy and paste this into your terminal:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashwanthvijay1234-debug/wifi_walkie/main/install.bat -OutFile $env:TEMP\w.bat; & $env:TEMP\w.bat; python wifi_walkie.py
```

For Windows CMD / Linux / Mac:
```bash
url -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashwanthvijay1234-debug/wifi_walkie/main/install.sh -o /tmp/w.sh && chmod +x /tmp/w.sh && /tmp/w.sh && python3 wifi_walkie.py
```

This magical one-liner will:
- ✅ Check for Python installation
- 🔧 Verify pip package manager
- 📦 Upgrade pip for best compatibility
- 🔐 Install the cryptography library
- 📥 Download the Wi-Fi Walkie-Talkie app
- 📝 Create requirements.txt
- 💡 Show inspiring tech quotes along the way!

> 🔍 **Security Note**: This short URL redirects to our official [GitHub Gist installer script](https://gist.github.com/ashwanthvijay1234-debug/b3fb8fb03575d0fe6dd0f6ab9f8fc3d2). You can inspect the code there before running!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Run the App

*(If you used the installer, dependencies are already installed!)*

```bash
python wifi_walkie.py
```

### Step 2: Chat!

1. Enter your nickname (something fun!)
2. Choose your mode:
   - **Public Mode (1)**: Everyone on Wi-Fi can see messages
   - **Secret Mode (2)**: Share a secret word with friends for encrypted chat
3. Start chatting! 💬

## 🎮 How It Works

### Network Communication
- Uses **UDP Broadcasting** on port 50050
- Automatically discovers peers on the same Wi-Fi network
- Broadcasts presence every 5 seconds
- Peers timeout after 15 seconds of silence

### Encryption (Secret Mode)
- Uses **Fernet symmetric encryption** from the `cryptography` library
- Key derivation with **PBKDF2HMAC** (100,000 iterations)
- SHA-256 hashing for secure key generation
- Only users with the exact same secret word can decrypt messages

### User Interface
- **Header**: Cute Wi-Fi logo with signal bars and hearts ♥
- **Status Bar**: Shows mode, your name, and online peer count
- **Chat Area**: 
  - Your messages → Right-aligned with green background ✓
  - Others' messages → Left-aligned with cyan background 💬
  - System messages → Gray timestamps for join/leave events
- **Input**: Simple "Type here >" prompt

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This app was created to make command-line tools feel **approachable and fun**, not intimidating:

- ❌ No scary black-and-green "hacker" terminals
- ✅ Soft pastel colors (cyan, yellow, warm white)
- ✅ Friendly error messages ("Oops!" instead of tracebacks)
- ✅ Cute loading animations (bouncing dots)
- ✅ Emojis for visual feedback (👋, 💬, ✓, ♥)
- ✅ Rounded ASCII art instead of harsh lines

## 📱 Platform Support

- **Windows**: CMD and PowerShell (uses `msvcrt` for non-blocking input)
- **Linux/macOS**: Terminal with ANSI color support
- **Cross-platform**: Works anywhere Python 3 runs!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Can't bind to port" Error
- Another instance might already be running
- Firewall may be blocking the port
- Try closing other instances or check firewall settings

### "Missing dependency" Error
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

### No peers showing up
- Make sure you're on the same Wi-Fi network
- Check if firewall is blocking UDP port 50050
- Try restarting the app on both devices

### Colors not displaying correctly
- Some terminals don't support ANSI colors
- Try using Windows Terminal, PowerShell, or a modern terminal emulator

## 🛠️ For Developers

### File Structure
```
wifi_walkie.py      # Main application (single file!)
requirements.txt    # Dependencies
README.md          # This file
```

### Key Classes
- `Colors`: ANSI color codes for friendly styling
- `CryptoHelper`: Encryption/decryption utilities
- `NetworkHandler`: UDP broadcasting and peer management
- `WalkieTalkieUI`: User interface and input handling

### Customization Ideas
- Change the ASCII logo in `WIFI_LOGO`
- Adjust colors in the `Colors` class
- Modify `PEER_TIMEOUT` in `NetworkHandler` for faster/slower peer detection
- Add custom emojis or status indicators
